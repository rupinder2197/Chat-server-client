# Chat-server-client
A simple java program to chat between server and client based on networking
server.java- this file contains a simple file server.This is implemented through ServerSocket class which contains the port number.
client.java- this file contains the Socket class local IP and port number is passed as the arguements.Client gets connected to the server
and chating can be done between server and client.

type "bye" to stop the chat between server and client

Actually I have upgraded it but wasn't able to upload it on github. I made it somewhat like team viewer where screen can be shared between client and server. Also one can share file across client and server.
